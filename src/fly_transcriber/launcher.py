"""A ``FLY.app`` in the Applications folder, so the app can be opened like any other.

The app is otherwise only a command-line tool and a login item: once quit, the
menubar icon is gone with nothing in Spotlight or Launchpad to bring it back.
The bundle here is a stub that starts that tool with ``--show``. It has no Dock
icon (``LSUIElement``) and needs no signing beyond an ad-hoc one.

Installed in ``/Applications`` when the user may write there (admin users can,
no ``sudo`` involved) and in ``~/Applications`` otherwise.
