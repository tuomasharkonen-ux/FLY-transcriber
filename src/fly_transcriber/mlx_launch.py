"""Run the ownscribe CLI with MLX Whisper in place of faster-whisper.

ownscribe transcribes with faster-whisper on the CPU, which is most of the wait
after a recording. MLX runs the same Whisper model on the Mac's GPU, about four
times faster. Capture, diarization, the output files and the log lines
``recorder.py`` reads stay ownscribe's: only the object it calls
``.transcribe(audio, ...)`` on is replaced.

Word timings come from Whisper itself, not from whisperx's wav2vec2 alignment,
which ownscribe is told to skip. Alignment needs a 0.4-4 GB model per language,
downloaded at the first meeting in that language -- a surprise download, and a
failed transcript when offline. Whisper's own timings are a little less precise
at speaker changes; ``transcript.py`` repairs the typical error.

This file runs on ownscribe's Python, not FLY's: ``recorder.ownscribe_command``
starts it with ``-P`` so FLY's own modules beside it are not importable, and it
imports nothing from FLY. It relies on these ownscribe 0.15 internals, which the
weekly upstream workflow checks: ``WhisperXTranscriber._load_model`` sets
``self._model``; ``_transcribe_inner`` calls ``self._model.transcribe(audio,
...)``, reads ``"segments"`` and ``"language"`` from the result, as from
whisperx, and aligns only if ``_should_align()``; ``_prepare_transcription_models``
takes ``load_align``.
