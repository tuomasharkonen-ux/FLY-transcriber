# the speaker model (no HuggingFace account needed) and the speech models, then
# registers a login item so the menubar icon starts with your Mac and adds FLY
# to Applications (/Applications when you may write there, else ~/Applications)
# so it can be opened from Spotlight after quitting.

# Options:

#   --warmup          download the ~3 GB speech models now, without asking
#   --no-warmup       download them later, during the first recording, without
#                     asking (otherwise the script asks; with no keyboard to ask
#                     on, it downloads now)
#   FLY_VERSION=v0.2.0 (environment) install that release instead of the latest;
#                     FLY_VERSION=main installs work in progress

# (on a fresh Mac, git is a stub that asks to install the developer tools).

When should FLY download its speech models (about 3 GB)?

  1) Now (recommended): FLY is ready to use as soon as this finishes.
  2) Later: install the app now. The models then download during your
     first recording, so that first transcript takes longer and needs
     an internet connection.

Installing FLY, the Faithful Logger of Yapping.

FLY records your meetings and turns them into transcripts that show who said
what. Everything happens on this Mac: FLY uses local AI models for speech
recognition, so your audio never leaves your computer and it works offline.

Those models are big, about 3 GB to download (about 5 GB of disk space in
all), and FLY needs them to make transcripts. They download once.

The whole install takes about 5 to 20 minutes, mostly the download. You can
keep using your Mac meanwhile, but leave this window open until it says
"FLY is installed".
